# What the hell is AiC4EI?

AiC4EI is a web application which allows free interaction with ChatGPT using Python's GPT4FREE library. The software is written in JavaScript, using NodeJS + [Express](https://expressjs.com/es/4x/api.html) + [SocketIO](https://socket.io/) on the server side and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) on the Frontend.

The backend allows different clients to communicate with ChatGPT. If your purpose with AiC4EI is to use it for your own ends or purposes, you can only mount the Backend server in your network and ignore the other side of the application, that is, the client; the backend allows its interaction through the API, or you can use the connection by WebSocket using some SocketIO client.

## Before you start the installation
Installing AiC4EI on your computer or server is relatively simple, you shouldn't have any major complications in the process; however, before you start cloning the repository, make sure you have at least `NodeJS v18.0.0` and `Python v3.10`.

Consider that, in case you do not have the required NodeJS version installed on your system, you can use the version manager [`NVM (Node Version Manager)`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

```bash
# Installing NVM on your system...
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && (
  git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git "$NVM_DIR"
  cd "$NVM_DIR"
  git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags --match "v[0-9]*" $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)`
) && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# Once NVM has been installed, we proceed to install the specified NodeJS version (> 18.0.0)
nvm install 18.0.0
```

If you don't have `Python v3.10` on your system, you might consider the following:

```bash
# (DEBIAN)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3.10

# (MacOS)
brew install python@3.10
```

In the same way, consider having pip installed on your system, since it will be used when installing the necessary modules to be able to mount the backend server within the network.

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py
```

Now, assuming you have the aforementioned dependencies installed on your system, we can proceed to the next step...
