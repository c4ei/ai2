# Cloning the repository and starting the installation
Before we start installing and configuring the backend server as the AiC4EI frontend, we need to clone the Github repository where the application source code is located.

Consider that, at this point in the reading, I assume that you already have Python version 3.10 or higher and NodeJS version 18.0.0; In the previous reading, before proceeding with the installation, the steps to install each one of them were explained.

```bash
# Cloning the Github repository that contains the source code (I stole it from a cyber).
git clone https://github.com/rodyherrera/Lovelace/ && cd AiC4EI

# Accessing the "Client" folder, which stores the source code of the 
# Vite + ReactjS (Frontend) application, and then installing its required modules from NPM.
cd Server && npm install --force && pip install -r Requirements.txt

# Like the previous line, we access the "Server" folder that houses the source code 
# for the AiC4EI Backend, then we install the NPM packages required to mount on the network.
cd ../Client && npm install --force 
```

You may prefer to run everything in just one line...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodyherrera/Lovelace/ && cd AiC4EI && cd Server && npm install --force && pip install -r Requirements.txt && cd ../Client && npm install --force && cd ..
```

Keep in mind that, when you install the necessary modules to run the server, the `pip install -r Requirements.txt` command is executed in order to install the necessary packages to be able to use the `GPT4FREE` library. from Python. If you don't have `pip` installed or you don't install the Python packages, even though you have the backend server and the client mounted on the network, you won't be able to do anything, because when a request is made to both Through WebSocket's or via API using the NodeJS `python-shell` library from the backend, communication is made to the corresponding Python file that is in charge of returning the response and if it does not have its necessary requirements, it will throw an error.

## Knowing a little more about the contents of the cloned repository...
Once you've cloned the Github repository, we can move on to configuring and network-mounting both the frontend and backend applications, however, let's dig a little deeper into what stores each subfolder that contains the folder generated by cloning the repository.

| Folder | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Client | The "Client" folder stores the source code of the Vite + React application, that is, the AiC4EI frontend, where you can mount the website on your network to be able to communicate with the backend and establish quality conversations with the AI! |
| Documentation | The "Documentation" folder houses the source code of the software docs: https://lovelace-docs.rodyherrera.com/. |
| Server | The "Server" folder houses the source code for the AiC4EI backend, where it is built under NodeJS using Express to provide the API and SocketIO for transmission of responses under WebSocket's. |

Also, apart from folders, you will come across some files, which in the same way will be presented together with a description below.

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| .clocignore | It is used by the "cloc" software, which allows counting the lines of software code, separating them by technology and the comments that the programming language used may have. Inside the "clocignore" file, there are the paths of those files and directories that the software must ignore when counting. |
| LICENSE | Contains the AiC4EI license to which the source code of the Client and Server are subject. This software is licensed under the MIT license. |
